WordPress popup is a timed popup box that shows up on your website, and can be used as a call to action to display products, sign up for newsletters, and mainly to get the attention of your website visitors in an appealing and non-intrusive manner. It has an options page which easily allows you to change the title, text, link and allows you to integrate your existing form or newsletter form with Shotcode support. You can easily connect your mailchimp, gravity forms, contact form 7 shortcodes and get subsribers!

This plugin also allows you to embed an image or a youtube video, and place link for your social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus and more.

## Newsletter Integration
You can use this plugin to display a form that you have already created with another plugin, such as **Mailchimp, Gravity Forms, Contact Form 7** or any other plugin that utilizes shortcodes.

### Mailchimp
* To setup mailchimp, I recommend using [Mailchimp for WordPress plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/mailchimp-for-wp/). Once setup, the plugin will give you a shortcode, usually *[mc4wp_form]* copy that shortcode and paste it in the Shortcode option of the WP Popup settings page

## Social Media Links
The plugin allows you to enter the URL's of your social media pages, enter the URLs, adn the social icons will appear in the popup
